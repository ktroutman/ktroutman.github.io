Thanks for visiting my personal page! This is intended to be a mix of projects, blog posts, and personal projects. If you find something interesting, I'd love to hear about it.

My interests include:
===
Economics: 
* wealth and income inequality measurement
* gender differences in wealth
* class inequality in technical fields

Machine learning: 
* unsupervised anomaly detection
* building active learning systems for organizations with weak labeling infrastructure
* explainable models, building basic end-to-end machine learning systems.

Activities: 
* boxing (watching it, doing it, talking about it)
* german literature (currently reading *Bekenntisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull*)
* leisurely running
